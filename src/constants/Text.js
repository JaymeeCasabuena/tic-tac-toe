    Credits: 'In a game of Tic Tac Toe, players Alice and Bob engage in a battle of X\'s and O\'s on a 3x3 grid. With strategic moves and tactical maneuvers, they vie for control. \nAlice starts strong with an X in the center, met by Bob\'s defensive O in a corner. The game escalates as each player seeks openings while blocking their opponent. \nIn a tense exchange, Alice sets up a potential win with her X along a diagonal, but Bob counters with a strategic O. The game reaches a deadlock as both players maneuver for victory. \nDespite their efforts, neither Alice nor Bob can secure a win, leading to a stalemate. The game ends, leaving the grid filled with X\'s and O\'sâ€”a testament to the skill and strategy employed by both players.',
    Rules: 'Objective: The objective of Tic Tac Toe is to be the first player to form a straight line (horizontal, vertical, or diagonal) of three of your marks (X or O) on the grid. \nGrid: The game is played on a 3x3 grid, creating nine squares where players can place their marks. \nPlayers: Tic Tac Toe is typically played by two players, one using X and the other using O. Players take turns placing their marks on the grid. \nStarting Player: The game usually begins with either player X or player O. In subsequent games, players may alternate who goes first. \nTaking Turns: Players take turns placing their mark in an empty square on the grid. Once a mark is placed, it cannot be moved. \nWinning: A player wins the game if they successfully create a straight line of three of their marks, either horizontally, vertically, or diagonally. Once a player wins, the game ends immediately. \nDraw (Stalemate): If all nine squares on the grid are filled and neither player has formed a winning line, the game ends in a draw, also known as a stalemate. \nEnding the Game: The game ends either when one player achieves victory or when the game reaches a stalemate. Players can then choose to start a new game.'
